    <p>
      JavaScript JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time
      compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is
      most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
      environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
      Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded,
      dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative
      (e.g. functional programming) styles. JavaScript's dynamic capabilities
      include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
      variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via
      for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript
      functions store their source text and can be retrieved through
      toString()). This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself,
      and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host
      environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages,
      please see Web APIs and DOM
